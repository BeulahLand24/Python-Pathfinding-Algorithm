### Interactive Setup

- Place a starting location by pressing the 'S' key.
- Create a target location with a left-click.
- Draw walls using right-click and hold to block the algorithm's path.

*Note:* Drawing walls may require holding down the mouse button/key and moving the cursor over the grid box you intend to draw on. Future commits will focus on streamlining this feature

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/BeulahLand24/Python-Pathfinding-Algorithm.git` 
Alternativly, you can download the file directly 
2. Open the `PathfindingProject.py` script and execute
3. Interact with the program:

- Place the starting location by pressing 'S' on your keyboard.
- Set the target location by left-clicking on the grid.
- Draw walls with right-click and drag to block the path.
- Press the spacebar to start Dijkstra's search algorithm
